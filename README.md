Samsung Galaxy AI Support Assistant 
A premium, high-end AI Support interface designed strictly according to the Samsung One UI design language. This project leverages an advanced Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to provide accurate, grounded support for Samsung products.
 Key Features
Premium Samsung Branding: Full-width responsive landing page with a "Galaxy Dark" theme and a clean "White & Blue" chatbot widget.
Agentic RAG Architecture:
Hybrid Retrieval: Combines FAISS vector search with GraphRAG (NetworkX) for deep context understanding.
Smart Web Fallback: Proactively asks for permission to search the web (via DuckDuckGo) when local manuals are insufficient, restricted strictly to `samsung.com`.
High Performance: Powered by the Cerebras Llama-3.1-8b model for sub-second inference speeds.
Multi-modal Support: Integrated Voice-to-Text (STT) for a hands-free experience.
Grounding & Guardrails: Strict rules to prevent hallucinations, pricing inaccuracies, and out-of-scope queries (Samsung products only).
 Technology Stack
Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11)
Frontend: React + Vite + Vanilla CSS
Vector DB: FAISS
Graph DB: NetworkX (Local GraphRAG)
AI Models: Llama 3.1 8B (via Cerebras), STT/Image Analysis (via Groq/OpenAI compatible)
Styling: Google Fonts (Outfit, Inter), Lucide Icons
